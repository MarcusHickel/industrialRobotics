Orbital servicing, assembly and manufacturing is becoming a bigger factor in the space industry as satellite providers want to be able to extend the lifespan of satellites.
This project aims to simulate and test the viability of using co-bot designs to perform in orbit servicing on satellites. This will be achieved by using one arm dock/hold/traverse the satellite and the other perform various tasks on it.

For our application the DOBOT CR10 is selected due to its wide working radius which can allow it to dock and mauver itself around satellites. 3D models and data specs are available online from the Dobot website.
